    <h1>Getting started</h1>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>
      Install the most recent <em>stable</em> version of
      <a href="http://nodejs.org/#download">node</a>, then clone
      <a href="https://github.com/caolan/kanso">kanso</a> from GitHub.
      Fetch the relevant submodules by doing the following in the cloned directory:
    </p>
    <pre>git submodule init
git submodule update</pre>
    <p>You are then ready to install:</p>
    <pre>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</pre>

    <h3>Using NPM</h3>
    <p>
    If you already have node.js installed, and you're using npm
    (Node Package Manager), then you can install by simply doing the following:
    </p>
    <pre>sudo npm install -g kanso</pre>

    <h3>Why does Kanso need node.js?</h3>
    <p>
      Node.js is used for the command-line tools only. With Kanso, the end result is a pure
      <a href="http://couchapp.org">CouchApp</a> you can host using CouchDB alone.
      Using node to write the associated tools allows us to do some powerful things
      by interpreting the JavaScript of your application.
    </p>

    <h2 id="starting_a_project">Starting a project</h2>
    <p>
      For this tutorial we'll be making a fairly typical blog, with posts,
      comments and users. Some familiarity with CouchDB is expected, but I'll
      try to explain the concepts as we go.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new project skeleton, enter the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>kanso create myblog</pre>
    <p>
      This creates a number of files and directories representing a basic
      project structure. We'll look more closely at the generated files later,
      but for a brief overview, the directories fall into the following categories:
    </p>
    <pre>myblog
  |- lib             CommonJS modules which define your app
  |- static          Static files such as jQuery and CSS
  |- templates       HTML templates used by the app
  |- kanso.json      Project configuration
    </pre>
    <p>
      This structure is a merely a guide and you are free to place files
      wherever it makes sense, provided you update the configuration settings in
      kanso.json.
    </p>

    <h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      It might seem early in the tutorial to start talking about deployment, but
      since your app needs to be hosted by CouchDB to run, we're going to cover it
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing to mention is that <em>Kanso apps are just CouchApps</em>. This means
      they can be hosted directly from your CouchDB instance, without any additional
      tier or services.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of this tutorial we're going to assume you have CouchDB running
      on <a href="http://localhost:5984">http://localhost:5984</a>
      (the default settings). If you haven't got a local copy of CouchDB running,
      go do that now.
    </p>

    <h3>Pushing</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>push</code> command uploads your app to a CouchDB database. You can find help
      on any of the commands used in this tutorial by typing <code>kanso help</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's push the new project to your CouchDB instance, and check that everthing
      works. To do this, enter the following command from your project directory:
    </p>
    <pre>kanso push http://localhost:5984/myblog</pre>
    <img src="images/deployment1.png" alt="pushing myblog" />
    <p>
      This creates a new database called 'myblog' and uploads your app to it.
      If you now visit <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/</a>,
      you should see the following welcome page:
    </p>
    <img src="images/deployment2.png" alt="pushing myblog" />
    <p>
      This is the location to use when testing your app. Don't worry about the
      ugly URL, we can fix this later using
      <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Virtual_Hosts">virtual hosts</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="describing_the_data">Describing the data</h2>
    <p>
      Now we've got our new project up and running, let's think about the data
      structures this project requires. Because CouchDB is schemaless, we can make
      lots of changes as we go without having to worry about doing ALTER TABLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only problem is, it can quickly get complicated when manually validating
      documents and checking permissions. Thankfully, kanso provides a powerful
      document validation and permissions tool in the form of Type definitions.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating types</h3>
    <p>
      In the skeleton project we created earlier, there's a file called
      <code>lib/types.js</code>. This is the conventional place to export types.
      Remember, the files in the <code>lib</code> directory are 
      <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1">CommonJS modules</a>.
      This means anything added to the <code>exports</code> object in this file is
      made visible to other modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's create a type for describing blog posts. Add the following to
      <code>lib/types.js</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var Type = require('kanso/types').Type,
    fields = require('kanso/fields'),
    widgets = require('kanso/widgets');


exports.blogpost = new Type('blogpost', {
    fields: {
        created: fields.timestamp(),
        title: fields.string(),
        text: fields.string({
            widget: widgets.textarea({cols: 40, rows: 10})
        })
    }
});
</code></pre>
    <p>
      That should be fairly self-explanatory.
      The first argument to the <code>Type</code> constructor is the type name
      which must be unique, the second argument is an object describing fields
      and other options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we've added a basic type, let's push these changes to the server:
    </p>
    <img src="images/deployment1.png" alt="pushing myblog" />

    <h3>The Admin App</h3>
    <p>
      As a useful way to play with data types, kanso provides a basic admin app.
      You can push this app to the same database you pushed the 'myblog' project to
      by using the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>kanso pushadmin http://localhost:5984/myblog</pre>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data1.png" alt="push the admin app" />
    <p>
      If you now visit
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/</a>
      you should see the following page:
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data2.png" alt="admin app - apps list" />
    <p>
      Because you can have multiple apps running on a single database you will be
      presented with a list of available applications. Click the 'myblog' app.
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data3.png" alt="admin app - app overview" />
    <p>
      Here, we are presented with a list of types. Currently, we just have the one
      'blogpost' type. Clicking on this will show you a list of existing blog posts:
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data4.png" alt="admin app - type list" />
    <p>
      Of course, we haven't added any yet. Let's try adding one now. Click the
      'Add blogpost' link.
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data5.png" alt="admin app - adding a type" />
    <p>
      As you can see, the admin app has read the field settings we defined earlier
      and presented us with a sensible form for adding blog posts. You'll notice the
      <code>timestamp</code> field is missing. This is because it's automatically
      populated with the current time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a blog post by filling out the form with some test data and clicking
      the create button.
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data6.png" alt="admin app - type added" />
    <p>
      As you can see, kanso has automatically populated the 'type' and 'created'
      fields. The 'type' field is automatically added, and reserved for use by
      kanso so we can identify the definition to validate against.
    </p>
    

    <h2 id="querying_the_data">Querying the data</h2>
    <p>
      In CouchDB, you query your documents using map / reduce functions called
      'views'. If you've never written a CouchDB view before, you can read up on
      it in the <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/views.html">Definitive Guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding a view to a kanso app couldn't be simpler. Just open up the
      <code>lib/views.js</code> file and add the following example view:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">exports.blogposts_by_created = {
    map: function (doc) {
        if (doc.type === 'blogpost') {
            emit(doc.created, doc.title);
        }
    }
};</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Push the app</strong>, then revisit the admin interface at
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/myblog">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/myblog</a>
      you'll see the view we created now appears:
    </p>
    <img src="images/querying_the_data1.png" alt="admin app - now showing a view" />
    <p>
      Clicking on the view shows the current results. You should see the document
      we created earlier keyed by its created at timestamp:
    </p>
    <img src="images/querying_the_data2.png" alt="admin app - view results" />
    <p>
      Clicking on a row will take you to its corresponding document.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rendering_pages">Rendering pages</h2>
    <p>
      In CouchDB, rendering custom representations of your data is achieved using
      <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Formatting_with_Show_and_List">List and Show functions</a>.
      Kanso is no different, although it will also run these functions client-side
      wherever possible, giving users a more responsive interface while also
      providing a fallback for search-engines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing code in this way can be very efficient and shows where you might be
      missing non-js support. However, at first it might seem a little odd. Work
      through the examples and bear in mind that all list and show functions could
      be run client-side or server-side at any time!
    </p>
    <h3>List functions</h3>
    <p>
      List functions format the results of a view. We're going to use a list
      function to show a list of blog posts on the homepage, ordered by the
      date they were created. Add the following to <code>lib/lists.js</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var templates = require('kanso/templates');


exports.homepage = function (head, req) {

    start({code: 200, headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}});

    // fetch all the rows
    var row, rows = [];
    while (row = getRow()) {
        rows.push(row);
    }

    // generate the markup for a list of blog posts
    var content = templates.render('blogposts.html', req, {
        rows: rows
    });

    if (req.client) {
        // being run client-side, update the current page
        $('#content').html(content);
        document.title = 'MyBlog';
    }
    else {
        // being run server-side, return a complete rendered page
        return templates.render('base.html', req, {
            content: content,
            title: 'MyBlog'
        });
    }

};</code></pre>
    <p>
      For simplicity, we're pre-fetching all the rows at once, on large views
      you'll want to return content for each row before fetching the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll notice this list function detects if its running client-side by
      checking the client property on the request object. When run client-side,
      it will update the DOM instead of returning a new HTML document.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also reference two templates: 'base.html' and 'blogposts.html'. The first
      was created as part of the project skeleton, but the second we need to create
      ourselves. Create a new template at <code>templates/blogposts.html</code> with
      the following content:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;My Blog&lt;/h1&gt;

{?rows}
  &lt;ul&gt;
    {#rows}
      &lt;li&gt;{value}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{baseURL}/{id}"&gt;{value}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    {/rows}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
{:else}
  &lt;p&gt;No blog posts&lt;/p&gt;
{/rows}</code></pre>
    <p>
      For more information on the template format used by kanso, see the
      <a href="http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/">Dust website</a>. Basically,
      this will render a list of blog post titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing worth noting is the use of {baseURL} in the template. This variable
      is automatically made available to templates by kanso, and refers to the
      current 'root' level URL. That would currently mean
      '/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite', but that may change if you use
      a virtual host in the future. For now, be sure to prefix all
      <strong>application</strong> URLs with the base URL.
    </p>
    <h3>Rewrites</h3>
    <p>
      Next, we need to hook this view up to a URL. CouchDB uses
      <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Rewriting_urls">rewrites</a>
      to point arbitrary URLs at CouchDB functions and again, kanso is no exception.
      Let's change the root URL from the welcome page to our new list of blog posts.
      Edit <code>lib/rewrites.js</code> to look like the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">module.exports = [
    {from: '/static/*', to: 'static/*'},
    {from: '/', to: '_list/homepage/blogposts_by_created'}
];</code></pre>
    <p>
      This uses our new list function in combination with the view query we created
      earlier. <strong>Push the app</strong>, then open it in your browser:
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="images/rendering_pages1.png" alt="The new homepage" />
    <p>
      Of course, clicking on the blog post will give a 404 Not Found error, since
      we've not implemented the view for a single blog post yet. Let's do that now.
    </p>
    <h3>Show functions</h3>
    <p>
      Show functions are like list functions, only they display a single document
      rather than the results of a view. We're going to create a show function
      for our blog posts, open up <code>lib/shows.js</code> and take a look.
      Currently, it will contain the welcome page we recently unhooked from our
      rewrite rules. You can now remove that, and replace it with the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var templates = require('kanso/templates');


exports.blogpost = function (doc, req) {

    // render the markup for a single blog post
    var content = templates.render('blogpost.html', req, doc);

    if (req.client) {
        // being run client-side
        $('#content').html(content);
        document.title = doc.title;
    }
    else {
        return templates.render('base.html', req, {
            content: content,
            title: doc.title
        });
    }

};</code></pre>
    <p>
      Then we need to add the <code>blogpost.html</code> template:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;{title}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{text}&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      And update the rewrite rules:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">module.exports = [
    {from: '/static/*', to: 'static/*'},
    {from: '/', to: '_list/homepage/blogposts_by_created'},
    {from: '/:id', to: '_show/blogpost/:id'}
];</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Push the app</strong> and try clicking the blog post link now.
      You should see a page similar to the following:
    </p>
    <img src="images/rendering_pages2.png" alt="Single blog post page" />
    <p>
      If you check your JavaScript console in Chrome or Firebug, you should notice
      that clicking on the blog post link on the homepage causes the next request to
      be handled client-side:
    </p>
    <img src="images/rendering_pages3.png" alt="Single blog post page" />
    <p>
      However, turning off JavaScript should provide you with the same experience.
      Just with your CouchDB server doing the work of rending pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As your sites become more complex you may want to make additional requests
      to the server when a list or show function is run client-side. This means
      we could show all blogposts with the same tag in a side-bar, or perhaps show
      links to related posts. These features would then be available only to people
      with JavaScript turned on, and browsers without JavaScript will fall-back to
      the core content you see now.
    </p>

    <h2 id="users_and_permissions">Users and permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, anyone can add a blog post to the site, even if they're not
      logged-in. This probably isn't ideal, so let's look at protecting the ability
      to add blog posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      CouchDB provides its own users and roles system, which defines who has
      access to which database. Kanso can also use this to authorize or
      reject changes to the database on a document-level. The great thing about
      this is that our authentication system is already set-up and ready to go!
    </p>
    <h3>validate_doc_update</h3>
    <p>
      CouchDB authorizes changes to a document using the
      <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/validation.html">validate_doc_update</a>
      function defined in your app. Of course, Kanso also supports this system as
      the underlying way to authorize changes. However, this method is quite
      low-level, simply accepting a new document, an old document and throwing
      an exception if the changes should be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplicity of this approach is both its attraction and its downfall. With
      complex applications comprising of many types, each with it's own
      validation and authorization requirements, your validate_doc_update function
      quickly becomes unwieldy.
      Kanso allows you to mix-and-match, by providing powerful tools
      on a type or even field-level, while still
      supporting the simplicity of the validate_doc_update approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look at <code>lib/validate.js</code> in the project skeleton we
      generated, you'll notice kanso has already added a
      validate_doc_update function which just calls the kanso function
      <code>types.validate_doc_update</code>. This runs the permissions
      defined in your app's type and field definitions, so it's
      important not to remove this line if you're using this feature.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var types = require('kanso/types'),
    app_types = require('./types');


module.exports = function (newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx) {
    types.validate_doc_update(app_types, newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx);
};</code></pre>

    <h3>End of the admin-party</h3>
    <p>
      By default, CouchDB has no users and everyone has the special "_admin" role.
      This makes playing around with CouchDB (and Kanso!) easy when you first
      install but obviously isn't very secure. If you haven't done so already,
      put an end to the <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/security.html#party">admin party</a>
      by visiting the <a href="http://localhost:5984/_utils/">Futon admin interface</a>
      and adding a new admin user:
    </p>
    <img src="images/users_and_permissions2.png" alt="fixing admin party" />

    <h3>Type-level permissions</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, we want to protect the ability to add, remove and update the
      blogpost type. To do this we simply update our type definition to include a
      permissions section:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var Type = require('kanso/types').Type,
    fields = require('kanso/fields'),
    widgets = require('kanso/widgets'),
    permissions = require('kanso/permissions');


exports.blogpost = new Type('blogpost', {
    permissions: {
        add:    permissions.hasRole('_admin'),
        update: permissions.hasRole('_admin'),
        remove: permissions.hasRole('_admin')
    },
    fields: {
        created: fields.timestamp(),
        title: fields.string(),
        text: fields.string({
            widget: widgets.textarea({cols: 40, rows: 10})
        })
    }
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Push the app</strong> (you may now be prompted for a username and
      password), if you then <strong>logout</strong> and go to the blogposts page
      in the admin app
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/myblog/types/blogpost">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/myblog/types/blogpost</a>
      then try to delete a blogpost, you should see the following:
    </p>
    <img src="images/users_and_permissions1.png" alt="admin app - role required" />
    <p>
      The same should happen when editing or adding new blog posts. Logging back in
      as an admin user should allow you to complete all of these operations again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short note on pushing as a user: if you include a username or both a username
      and password in the database URL, these credentials will be used to push the app.
    </p>
    <pre>kanso push http://user:password@localhost:5984/dbname
kanso push http://user@localhost:5984/dbname</pre>
    <p>
      You may not want to expose the password in your shell history so I'd
      recommend just putting the username in the URL, and kanso will know to
      prompt you for a password before attempting to push.

    <h2 id="embedded_types">Embedded types</h2>
    <p>
      Now we move on to one of Kanso's more advanced features: Embedded types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beacuse it often makes sense to 'de-normalize' your data in CouchDB you'll
      often find yourself embedding one document directly into another.
      Any Type system that's going to work properly will also need to support this
      technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can get quite tricky once you consider the permissions and validation
      requirements involved. Consider a situation where you'd like to embed
      comments on a blog post document. One user may be allowed to edit a blogpost,
      while another may only be allowed to comment on it. However, both users need to be able to
      update the document itself, since the comments are embedded within the blogpost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using embedded types, Kanso helps you handle these situations much more easily
      and define exactly which parts of a document can be edited by a user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not embedding one type within another document is a good idea
      often depends on the specific circumstances. Comments on blog posts for
      example, may be best added separately to the blog post document if you
      expect there to be a lot of commenting activity, otherwise you run the
      risk of conflicts, and CouchDB will have to write the whole list of
      comments every time you add a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of this example however, we're going to assume comments are
      very infrequent and that we prefer to make them available on the blog post
      document itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating the comment type</h3>
    <p>
      Before we can embed comments within the blogpost type, we need to define
      the comment type itself. Add the following to <code>lib/types.js</code>,
      <strong>BEFORE</strong> the blogpost type:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">exports.comment = new Type('comment', {
    permissions: {
        add: permissions.loggedIn(),
        update: permissions.usernameMatchesField('creator'),
        remove: permissions.usernameMatchesField('creator')
    },
    fields: {
        creator: fields.creator(),
        text: fields.string({
            widget: widgets.textarea({cols: 40, rows: 10})
        })
    }
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      You'll notice we're using some new permissions for this type,
      first <code>loggedIn</code> simply checks the user is logged in (not
      anonymous) before being allowed to add a comment. Then,
      <code>usernameMatchesField</code> checks that the current user is the same
      as the user defined in the creator field. This stops users from editing or
      deleting other users comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>creator</code> field is also new, and set's itself to the current
      user's name when a new comment is added. After creation, this field becomes
      uneditable.
    </p>

    <h3>Embedding a type</h3>
    <p>
      To embed a list of comments in a blogpost, update the blogpost type definition
      to include the following comments field:
    </p>
    <pre><code type="javascript">exports.blogpost = new Type('blogpost', {
    permissions: {
        add:    permissions.hasRole('_admin'),
        update: permissions.hasRole('_admin'),
        remove: permissions.hasRole('_admin')
    },
    fields: {
        created: fields.timestamp(),
        title: fields.string(),
        text: fields.string({
            widget: widgets.textarea({cols: 40, rows: 10})
        }),
        comments: fields.embedList({
            type: exports.comment
        })
    }
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Push the app</strong>, and visit the admin page for adding blogposts:
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/myblog/types/blogpost/add">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/myblog/types/blogpost/add</a>
    </p>
    <img src="images/embedded_types1.png" alt="new comments button" />
    <p>
      There is now an add a comment button, clicking on this will open a modal
      dialog for embedding a comment.
    </p>
    <img src="images/embedded_types2.png" alt="adding comments" />
    <p>
      Continue to add a new blog post with some example comments, rembering that
      you'll need to be logged in as an admin user to add new blog posts.
    </p>

    <h3>Updating templates</h3>
    <p>
      Let's update the templates to handle the newly embedded comments.
      Edit <code>templates/blogpost.html</code> to look like the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;{title}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{text}&lt;/p&gt;

{?comments}
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    {#comments}
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;{creator} says: &lt;/strong&gt;
        {text}
      &lt;/li&gt;
    {/comments}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
{/comments}</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Push the app</strong>, and visit it's home page:
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/</a>
    </p>
    <img src="images/embedded_types4.png" alt="app homepage" />
    <p>
      You should see the new blog post you created listed on the homepage.
      Clicking on it should show it using the new template, complete with the
      comments you added earlier:
